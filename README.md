ESP8266 EvilTwin & deauther all-in-one WiFi pen-testing tools.

## Introduction
This project is developed for ESP8266 EvilTwin & deauther all-in-one WiFi pen-testing tools. The addition of `Display` integration, `RSSI` (received signal strength indication), several changes to `captive pages`, some fixing and adjustments to the `ESP8266 Boards Manager` to avoid `errors when deauthing`, and fixed other issues like the `captive portal not opening automatically`.

<i>The name of this project is inspired by Zero Two from Darling In The Franxx</i>
